Good morning. The theme of my presentation is "Computers for the masses".

My presentation contains the following parts: Introduction. Advantages. Disadvantages. Conclusion.

Let's start with the introduction. Today computers are everywhere. Computers change people's personal and professional lives in many ways, with both positive and negative effects. 

On the one hand computers are very useful. For example, it is very difficult to replace computers with anything in production and in various scientific calculations. Moreover, now almost everyone has a computer at home. Thanks to it, we can communicate with people located anywhere in the world. Also using Internet there is the opportunity to buy tickets and just any goods through a computer. After all, the computer allows you to work anywhere or take university courses online. 

On the other hand, there are disadvantages of using computers. First of all, it can do harm our eyes. Another problem is that computers can be addictive for children. The most important problem is that due to hacker attacks, personal information or any important documents stored on computers can be stolen.

In conclusion I want to say, personally, I believe that computers greatly simplify our lives and make them better, and we should consider the disadvantages of using computers.

Thanks for your attention.
