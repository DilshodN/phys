Good morning. The theme of my presentation is "The University I study at".

My presentation contains the following parts: Introduction. History. Structure. Rankings. Conclusion.

I think everybody knows that education is necessary to be successful in our life. I would like to work in the field of IT or physics in the future. To get my profession I need a university graduation. So after finishing school I passed the entrance exams and entered NSU, the faculty of physics.

The University was opened in 1959 and had only one department: natural sciences. A year later, the academic Board of NSU took the decision to separate this faculty into two: the faculty of physics and the faculty of mathematics.

Now NSU has as many as 6 faculties and 3 institutes. Almost every faculty has several chairs. For example, the faculty of physics has 19 chairs. More than seven thousand students study at NSU, more than a thousand of them are foreigners. NSU is located in Akademgorodok, a few minutes walk are world-class laboratories in which students can work.

According to almost all ratings, NSU is the best university in Siberia. Also our university takes the 2nd place in the overall rankings among Russian universities. NSU is a one of the 21 Russian universities, which the state helps to get into the top 100 of the world ranking.

In conclusion, NSU is an excellent choice for those who would like to be engaged in science, business or technology. NSU will give you all the skills necessary for a great career in any sphere.
