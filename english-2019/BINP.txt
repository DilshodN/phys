Good morning. My name is Daniil Yakovlev and I'm a laboratory assistant at the Budker Institute of nuclear physics. The topic of my presentation is "The insitute where I have my practical training".

Content: History. Structure of the Institute. Main areas of research. Publications. Conclusion.

The Institute of Nuclear Physics was established in May 1958 on the basis of the Laboratory of New Methods of Acceleration, headed by Gersh Budker. The institute was built in Akademgorodok on Lavrentiev Avenue. Since 2015, the Institute has been headed by Academician Pavel Logachev.

Among the 400 researchers of the Institute there are 10 members and corresponding members of the Russian Academy of Sciences, more than 60 doctors and 170 candidates of science. BINP has its own large experimental plant with highly technological equipment. Also BINP is a basic institute for five chairs of the physics department of NSU.

At present, Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics is the largest academic institute of the Russian Federation, and one of the world's leading research centers in the field of elementary particle physics, accelerator physics, and controlled thermonuclear fusion. A number of key ideas and developments that determine the current world level of accelerator science and technology were proposed and implemented at Budker Institute. Today, two out of the six existing colliders are operating here.

BINP publishes more than a thousand scientific papers annually. In particular, works are published in magazines such as Science and Nature. The Institute is also a member of many collaborations, such as CERN, KEK, ITER.

In conclusion, the Institute of Nuclear Physics is one of the centers of fundamental science in the world. I am glad that I have the opportunity to do science there.

Thanks for your attention!
