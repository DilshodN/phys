Good morning. The theme of my presentation is "The moral responsibilities of scientists".

My presentation contains the following parts: Introduction. Next, we will consider two main opinions on this subject. Conclusion.

Today, as always, the question is -- do scientist have moral responsibility for their discoveries or not?

On the one hand, scientits, as privileged members of society, have underlying obligation to reveal information about potentially harmful discoveries, to enable their fellow-citizens to anticipate danger. For example, it is easier to convene an executive committee to decide on the manufacture of a new and potentially lethal gas, than to replace lost lives. In short, scientists do have a direct special duty to their fellow men.

On the other hand, people have now known how scientists work. No one has the right to forbid scientists to engage in any research if this discoveries doesn't violate global laws. Because firsly, discoveries are not usually the work of one person, but of a team. Secondly, one scientific advance follows the other, and each leap forward opens up new fields for further research. Thirdly, discoveries have a habit of being made almost simultaneously by scientists working independently of each other in different parts of the world.

Personally, I agree with the second position and I believe, that the duty of scientists is to discover as mush as they can about people and universe. Responsobility for using the discoveries on the shoulders of those who use them.

Thanks for your attention.
