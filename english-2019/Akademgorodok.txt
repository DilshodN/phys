Good morning. The theme of my presentation is "Akademgorodok"

My presentation contains the following parts: Introduction. History. Current state. Akademgorodok 2.0. Conclusion.

Let's begin with the introduction. Akademgorodok is one of the most important scientific and educational centers in Russia. Akademgorodok is famous through discoveries in the field of physics, chemistry, biology and economics. In addition, the territory of Akademgorodok is mostly covered with forest, which provides a good environment.

It was founded in 1957 on the initiative of Academician Lavrentiev, Sobolev and Khristianovich. It was the first big scientific center built outside Moscow. In subsequent years, more than 20 institutes, housing areas and Novosibirsk State University were built there. Scientists from all over the Soviet Union came to Academgorodok with their families and stayed there for all their lives.

Now, let's move on to the current state. Science is a heart of Akademgorodok. Detectors and other components for the Large Hadron Collider have been developed at the Institute of Nuclear Physics. The Institute of Cytology and Genetics is studying viruses from the inside. NSU opens the door to real science for its students. Another great step of scientific life of Akademgorodok was the Technopark. It is a place where research turns into industrial technologies.

What awaits us in the future? Akademgorodok 2.0. This is a federal funding project primarily for the science and infrastructure of Akademgorodok. Many objects will be built, the most famous is the SKIF synchrotron. The NSU campus will be expanded.

In conclustion, I want to say that Akademgorodok is a unique town with friendly and nice citizens. I think, It is the best place to live in!

Thanks for your attention.
