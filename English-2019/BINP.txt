Good morning. My name is Daniil Yakovlev and I'm a laboratory assistant at the Institute of nuclear physics. The topic of my presentation is "The insitute where I have my practical training".

Content: History. Structure of the Institute. Main areas of research. Publications. Conclusion.

The Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences was established in May 1958 on the basis of the Laboratory of New Methods of Acceleration, headed by G.I. Budker. Since 2015, the Institute has been headed by Academician Pavel Logachev. The Institute is located in Akademgorodok on Lavrentiev Avenue.

Among the 440 researchers of the Institute there are 10 members and corresponding members of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), more than 60 doctors and 170 candidates of science. BINP has a large experimental plant (about 1000 people) with highly technological equipment. BINP is a basic institute for five subdepartments of the physics department of the NSU.

At present, Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics of SB RAS is the largest academic institute of the Russian Federation, and one of the world's leading research centers in the field of elementary particle physics, accelerator physics, and controlled thermonuclear fusion. A number of key ideas and developments that determine the current world level of accelerator science and technology were proposed and implemented at Budker Institute. Today, two out of the six existing colliders are operating here.

BINP publishes more than a thousand scientific papers annually. Often, works are published in magazines such as Science and Nature. The Institute is also a member of many collaborations, such as CERN, KEK, ITER.

In conclusion, the Institute of Nuclear Physics is one of the centers of fundamental science in the world. I am glad that I have the opportunity to do science there.

Thanks for your attention!
