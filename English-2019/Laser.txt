Good morning. My name is Daniil Yakovlev and I'm a student at the physics department of NSU. The theme of my presentation is "Laser: supertool of 20th century".

My presentation contains the following parts: Introduction. Laser properties. Applications. Conclusion.

The word laser is an acronym that means light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. More specifically, a laser is a device that produces a very special kind of light. The beam that is emitted by the laser differs from the light that comes out of a flashlight in four basic ways.

Laser light is intensive. Intensity is a measure of power per unit area. An ordinary light bulb emits more light than a small laser, but that light spreads out all over the room.
Laser beams are narrow and will not spread out like ordinary light beams. This quality is called directionality. 
Laser light is coherent. This means that all the light waves coming out of the laser are lined up with each other. 
Laser light is monochromatic. It means that lasers produce light of only one colour. In turn, ordinary light includes the entire visible spectrum. Mixed together, they come out white.

Lasers have an incredible amount of applications. Lasers are already common place items among military. In medicine lasers can do what a knife can't: weld the retina back to the eyeball. In science and technology, lasers are of great importance. They allow us to study the properties of various materials and cut steel.
 
Thus, the laser is the tool with very useful properties, which has found its application in various areas of our lives.

Thanks for your attention.
